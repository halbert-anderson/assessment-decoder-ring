# assessment-decoder-ring
This decoder ring project is an assessment to see if I can write more complicated code and write unit tests for that code to assure it is working the
way it is suppose to. The goal of the project is to write three different ciphers to encode and decode messages. The three ciphers are the Ceasar mehtod, 
the polybius method and the substitution method. The Ceasr method shifts the alphabet by a certain amount  and every letter of the origianl message can be 
coded and decoded using the shifted alphabets. The polybius method uses a 5by5 grid on an x/y axis to define what each alphabet is coded to, so each alphabet 
character has a pair of numbers to define it. Lastly, but not least, the substitution method simply transposes 26 unique characters to the original alphabet and 
uses the transposed chracters as the key for cipher.
